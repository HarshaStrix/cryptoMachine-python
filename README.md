# cryptoMachine-python

## Description
* A python project related and used to create a cryptography machine using the Shift Cipher.
* Shift Ciphers work by using the modulo operator to encrypt and decrypt messages.The Shift Cipher has a key, we will only share this key with people that we want to see our message.
* A cipher should prevent an attacker, who has a copy of the cipher text but does not know the key, from discovering the contents of the message. Since we only have 26 choices for the key, someone can easily try all of the 26 keys, one by one, until they recover the message. This type of attack is called a brute force attack.
